## Getting Started

I implemented a version of the Arkanoid game, as part of the OOP course in the university.
The game contains various levels with increasing difficulty, in a gui friendly platform.
I implemented the game with Java language using Intellij IDEA Ultimate IDE, using the following OOP principals:

* Polymorphism and inheritance.
* Usage of basic design patterns in OOP, such as Observer, Builder, etc.
* Usage of several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and arraylists.
* Working with GUI.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

* Windows / Linux / macOS
* Apache Ant
